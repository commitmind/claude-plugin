# the model answers the hook instead of the review prompt, so the review parses
# hook chatter as its result and reports "0 of N batches reviewed" (task
# 425ecbb). `if` rather than `&&` so a failed test can't trip `set -e`.

# just-logged observation is verdict-shaped (a conclusion backed by
# evidence) and was not already type='harvest_candidate', nudge the
# agent to capture it as a harvest_candidate so it reaches /harvest.
# Logic lives in `commitmind hook harvest-verdict` (Go subcommand).
# Per-session dedup so one session gets at most one verdict nudge.
#
# Silent-allow when the commitmind binary isn't on PATH.
