# CommitMind's own local review agent runs `claude -p` with the REPO as cwd, so
# it inherits these hooks. Their output is injected into that agent's context and
# the model answers the hook instead of the review prompt, so the review parses
# hook chatter as its result and reports "0 of N batches reviewed" (task
# 425ecbb). `if` rather than `&&` so a failed test can't trip `set -e`.

# CommitMind Stop hook: warns when the active task accumulated >= N
# Edit/Write calls without advancing phase. Logic lives in
# `commitmind hook stuck-design` (Go subcommand). This launcher pipes
# the Claude Code stdin envelope to the subcommand and forwards its
# stdout (a {"systemMessage":"..."} JSON envelope when the daemon
# decides to warn) and exit code (always 0 — Stop-hook warnings are
# informational, not blocking).
#
# Silent-allow when the commitmind binary isn't on PATH.
